I created this menstrual cycle calendar for a couple reasons. For data privacy, I wanted a menstruation calendar for my personal use. Further, while the supplemental options provided in existing menstruation apps can be very useful, I opt for a simpler interface. I wanted a calendar with one purpose and one purpose only: to mark the dates of menstruation.
